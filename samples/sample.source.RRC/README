GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The 3GPP TS 25.331 RRC (Radio Resource Control) PER decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../rrc.asn1 file.

THERE IS NO rrc.asn1 FILE THERE YET!

OBTAINING THE RRC SPECIFICATION
================================

Due to licensing restrictions, asn1c can not include the RRC ASN.1 module
in its distribution.

To obtain the RRC ASN.1 specification, you should go to
	http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/25331.htm
and download any version of RRC specification (preferably 7.1.0, 2006-06).

A .ZIP file with a Microsoft Word .DOC files will download shortly.

You should extract the ASN.1 modules from the chapter 11 of that .DOC file,
and save it as the ../rrc.asn1 file. The ../rrc.asn1 file should start with
the following line
	"Class-definitions DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::="
and end with the "END" token.
Be careful not to copy any preambles, chapter titles and other non-ASN.1 text.

After obtaining the rrc.asn1, type `make` in the directory containing
this README file.

rrc-dump USAGE
==============

The rrc-dump utility may be used to dump the contents of a PER-encoded
RRC protocol data unit. Since RRC specification contains multiple PDUs,
a PDU must be selected manually using -p <PDU> command line option:

	./rrc-dump    -p DL-DCCH-Message    message.per
	./rrc-dump    -p PCCH-Message    message.per

The list of recognized PDUs may be obtained using `-p list`.

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./rrc-dump -h
